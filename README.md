# countAT-bugs
Practice makes us better; usually debugging makes code closer to perfect. This program is supposed to ask the user to enter a DNA sequence and then output the AT content of the sequence— total number of As and Ts divided by the sequence length—as a fraction of the total sequence length (a number between 0 and 1).  

For example, given the string:  AAAATGAATGGCTAACTTTTGAA 

the program should output: (make sure that you pay attention to the number of significant digits in the output!)  

AT content = 0.739
